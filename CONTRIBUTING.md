## Getting Started

This project is a React TypeScript application built with Create React App. To get started:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brittanyellich/brittanyellichprojects.git
   cd brittanyellichprojects
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   This will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the existing code style and patterns in the project

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly (see [Running Tests](#running-tests))

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push your branch** and create a pull request
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Running Tests

**Running tests is mandatory before merging any code.** This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing.

### Run all tests
```bash
npm test
```

This will run tests in watch mode. To run tests once (useful for CI/CD):

```bash
npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

### Test Coverage
All tests must pass before code can be merged. The project currently has:
- Component tests for UI components
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for key features

### Writing Tests
When adding new features or fixing bugs:
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update existing tests if behavior changes
- Follow the existing test patterns in the codebase
- Ensure tests are meaningful and cover edge cases

## Building the Project

Before submitting a pull request, ensure the project builds successfully:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder. The build must complete without errors.

## Before Submitting a Pull Request

- [ ] **Run all tests** and verified they pass
  ```bash

- [ ] **Updated documentation** if your changes affect:
  - How the project is used
  - Installation or setup instructions
  - Available commands or scripts
  - API or component interfaces

- [ ] **Reviewed your changes** to ensure:
  - Code follows existing patterns and style
  - No unnecessary files are included
  - Comments are clear and helpful
  - No console.log statements or debug code remains

- [ ] **Tested your changes** manually in the browser to ensure:
  - UI works as expected
  - No console errors appear
  - Responsive design is maintained
  - Accessibility is not compromised
